I want to build a simple crud service to manage blocked users in mariaDB.
- table columns: id, user_id, blocked_at, blocked_by, block_reason.
- expose endpoints to add or delete blocked users
- use H2 for dev, mariadb for uat and prod
- use jpa
- configuration use yaml
- follow DDD design pattern
help to design first
